## Trainee Team Member-Senior Team Member
{:.text-red-300}
Trainee, Junior, and Senior Team Members must attend training sessions for a chance at a promotion. Training sessions are held several times each day, providing staff members with plenty of opportunities to rank up. The training schedule can be found in the in-game staff room or through the communications server. 

## Management Intern-Assistant Manager
{:.text-red-300}
Management Interns, Team Leaders, Store Supervisors, and Assistant Managers must attend shifts and receive recognition from the shift host for a chance at a promotion. Utilizing proper grammar, behaving professionally, and showing dedication at all times will increase one's chances of a promotion. Although Middle Ranks are not required to utilize grammar at BloxStreet, they must if they wish to receive a promotion. Note that attending a shift does not guarantee a promotion. Hinting for a promotion or complaining about not receiving one will result in a logged warning and a demotion to Customer if repeated. Team Leaders, Store Supervisors, and Assistant Managers are also required to be off cooldown in order to receive a promotion. Another way to get promoted is by being noticed by an SHR outside of a shift. Staff members may not recommend other workers to an SHR for a promotion. Doing so will result in consequences.

## Store Manager-Store Executive
{:.text-red-300}
There are multiple factors the administration team looks at when promoting a Store Manager to Store Director. The same applies to HR promotions.

Store Managers wishing to receive a promotion should remain active on all BloxStreet games and its communications server, utilize proper grammar, behave professionally, and show dedication at all times. Junior Moderator+ can promote Store Managers at random times. These promotions are more difficult than Management Intern - Assistant Manager ones and often require more time and effort. Store Managers must prove to SHRs that they are prepared to fulfill the duties of an HR. Additionally, purchasing ranks will significantly decrease one's chances of a promotion to an HR rank. However, purchasing ranks will not restrict a player from earning an HR rank.

### **Store Manager Promotion Guide:**

> 1.   Store Managers should utilize proper grammar in all BloxStreet games if they wish to be recommended for a promotion.
> 2.   Store Managers must possess a certain number of characteristics (professionalism, maturity, respect, etc.).
> 3.   Having past moderation history (warnings, kicks, server bans, blacklists, etc.) will significantly decrease one's chances of a promotion to an HR rank. However, past moderation history will not restrict a player from earning an HR rank.
> 4.   Store Managers wishing to receive a promotion should remain active in the communications server. Talking in channels and attending events does help.
> 5.   Store Managers should work frequently at the store and attend training sessions. It is highly recommended to remain consistent with activity. For example, spend an hour at the store each day rather than seven hours one day and then a break for a week. Additionally, attend a reasonable number of training sessions. Be sure to work at a department when at the store. Going off-duty, supervising, cleaning spills, or restocking items will not increase one's chances of a promotion.
> 6.   Do not suck up to SHRs for a promotion. Store Managers may be rank locked from obtaining Store Director if caught simping. 
> 7.   Hinting for a promotion will not benefit one in any way. Doing so will result in a logged warning and a demotion to Customer if repeated.
> 8.   Upon encountering a disruptive customer, deal with them calmly and professionally. Follow the appropriate procedures for handling a disruptive customer. 
> 9.   Greetings should be unique and original. Copying and pasting, adding emojis, and using moderate vocabulary is strongly recommended.
> 10.  It is recommended to have current or past experience as an MR+ at a well-known group (i.e. Pastriez, SizzleBurger, Koala Cafe). However, current or past experience is not  required. 
> 11.  Store Managers wishing to receive a promotion should not idle once or until their cooldown has ended. Store Manager promotions require a great deal of patience and consistency.

> Keep in mind that these include only some requirements Store Managers must meet.
