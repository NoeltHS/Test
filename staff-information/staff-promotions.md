## Trainee Team Member-Senior Team Member
{:.text-red-300}
Trainee, Junior, and Senior Team Members must attend training sessions to progress in their ranks. These sessions are hosted multiple times a day, providing LRs with ample chances to earn promotions. The schedule for these training sessions can be accessed in the in-game staff room or [here](https://discord.com/channels/323081832071561216/600732254502780928/1133663177549299794).

## Management Intern-Assistant Manager
{:.text-red-300}
To increase the likelihood of receiving a promotion, Management Interns, Team Leaders, Store Supervisors, and Assistant Managers should actively participate in shifts and strive to be recognized by a shift host. It is crucial to maintain professionalism, utilize proper grammar, and consistently demonstrate dedication. While Middle Ranks are not required to use grammar, it is necessary in-game if they wish to be considered for a promotion. Attending shifts and exhibiting exemplary behavior does not guarantee a promotion, as promotions are determined by a combination of factors. It is important to avoid hinting or complaining about not receiving a promotion, as this can result in disciplinary actions, including a logged warning or demotion to the Customer rank. Additionally, Team Leaders, Store Supervisors, and Assistant Managers must be off cooldown to be eligible for a promotion. Another pathway for a promotion is to be noticed by an SHR outside of a shift. Recommending other staff members to an SHR for a promotion is not permitted.

## Store Manager-Store Executive
{:.text-red-300}
When considering promotions from Store Manager to Store Director, as well as promotions within the HR ranks, the administration team takes into account various factors.

To increase the chances of receiving a promotion, Store Managers should be active on all BloxStreet games and its communications server, consistently utilize proper grammar in-game, display professional behavior, and demonstrate dedication. Promotions for Store Managers are at the discretion of Junior Moderator+ and may occur at random times. These promotions are typically more challenging compared to promotions from Management Intern to Assistant Manager, requiring a greater investment of time and effort. Store Managers must prove to SHRs that they are fully prepared to undertake the responsibilities of an HR role.

### **Store Manager Promotion Guide:**

> 1.   Store Managers must utilize proper grammar in all BloxStreet games.
> 2.   Store Managers must possess a certain number of characteristics, such as professionalism, maturity, and respect.
> 3.   Having past moderation history will significantly decrease an individual's chances of a promotion to an HR rank. However, past moderation history will not restrict a player from earning an HR rank.
> 4.   Store Managers wishing to receive a promotion should remain active in the communications server. Talking in channels and attending events does help.
> 5.   Store Managers should work frequently at the store and attend training sessions. It is highly recommended to remain consistent with activity. For example, spend an hour at the store each day rather than seven hours one day and then a break for a week. Additionally, attend a reasonable number of training sessions. Be sure to work at a department when at the store. Going off-duty, supervising, cleaning spills, or restocking items will not increase an individual's chances of a promotion.
> 6.   Avoid sucking up to SHRs for a promotion. Store Managers may be rank locked from obtaining Store Director if caught simping. 
> 7.   Hinting for a promotion will not benefit one in any way. Doing so will result in a logged warning and a demotion to Customer if repeated.
> 8.   Upon encountering a disruptive customer, deal with them calmly and professionally. Refer to the [appropriate procedures](https://support.bloxstreet.store/guides/punishment-guide.html) for handling a disruptive customer. 
> 9.   Greetings should be unique and original. Copying and pasting, adding emojis, and using moderate vocabulary is strongly recommended.
> 10.  It is recommended to have current or past experience as an MR+ at a prominent establishment. However, current or past experience is not mandatory. 
> 11.  Store Managers wishing to receive a promotion should not idle once or until their cooldown has ended. Store Manager promotions require a great deal of patience and consistency.
> 12.  Grammar in the Discord server does not play a role in promotions.

> Keep in mind that these include only some requirements Store Managers must meet.

## Cooldowns
