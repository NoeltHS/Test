Here you will find information regarding promotions at BloxStreet! Keep in mind that promotions are a **privilege**, not a **right**.

## Trainee Team Member-Senior Team Member
{:.text-red-300}
In order to receive a promotion as a Trainee Team Member, Junior Team Member, or Senior Team Member, you must attend and pass a training session. Attending and passing one training session will rank you up once.

## Management Intern-Assistant Manager
{:.text-red-300}
In order to receive a promotion as a **Management Intern, Team Leader, Store Supervisor, or Assistant Manager**, you should attend and be noticed at a shift. Utilizing proper grammar, behaving professionally, and showing dedication will increase your chances of a promotion. Attending a shift does not guarantee a promotion. Team Leaders, Store Supervisors, and Assistant Managers are required to be off cooldown in order to receive a promotion. Another way to get promoted is by being noticed by an SHR outside of a shift. Staff members may NOT recommend other staff members to an SHR for a promotion.

## Store Manager-Store Executive
{:.text-red-300}
There are multiple factors the administration team looks at when promoting a Store Manager to Store Director. The same applies when we do HR promotions.

If you are a Store Manager+, you should remain active on all BloxStreet games and its communications server, utilize proper grammar, behave professionally, and show dedication in order to have a chance of a promotion. Junior Moderator+ can promote Store Managers at random times every day. These promotions are more difficult than Management Intern - Assistant Manager ones and often require time and effort. Additionally, purchasing ranks decreases your chances to earn an HR rank.

### **Store Manager Promotion Guide:**
{:.text-blue-000}
{: .no_toc }

> 1.   Store Managers must utilize proper grammar in all BloxStreet games.
> 2.   Store Managers must possess a certain number of characteristics (professionalism, maturity, respect, etc.) 
> 3.   Having past moderation history (warnings, kicks, server bans, blacklists, etc.) significantly decreases your chance of a promotion.  
> 4.   Store Managers should be in the communications server. Talking in channels and attending events does help! 
> 5.   Store Managers should frequently work at the store and attend training sessions. It is highly recommended to spread your time out at the store each week. For example, spend an hour at the store each day rather than seven hours one day and then a break for a week. Additionally, attend a reasonable number of training sessions. Be sure to WORK when youâ€™re at the store. Going off-duty or supervising will not increase your chances of a promotion. 
> 6.   Please do NOT suck up to SHRs for a promotion. Store Managers may be blacklisted from obtaining Store Director if caught simping. 
> 7.   Hinting for a promotion will not benefit you in any way. 
> 8.   If you encounter a disruptive customer, deal with them calmly and professionally. Follow the procedures for handling a disruptive customer. 
> 9.   Greetings should be unique. We recommend copying and pasting, adding emojis, and using moderate vocabulary. 
> 10.  It is recommended to have current or past experience as an MR+ at a well-known group (i.e. Pastriez, SizzleBurger, Koala Cafe). However, current or past experience is not  required. 

> Keep in mind that these are only some requirements Store Managers must meet.

## Cooldowns 
{:.text-red-300}
Most BloxStreet ranks have cooldowns. A cooldown is a period of time when you cannot be promoted.

| Cooldowns | 
|:----------|
| Trainee Team Member: None |
| Junior Team Member: None |
| Senior Team Member: None |
| Management Intern: None |
| Team Leader: 3 days |
| Store Supervisor: 3 days |
| Assistant Manager: 5 days |
| Store Manager: 2 weeks |
| Store Director: 2 weeks |
| Board of Directors: 1 month |
| Executive Assistant: 1 month |

Working at the store while on cooldown will increase your chances of a promotion.

## Points 
{:.text-red-300}
Another way to rank up at BloxStreet is by earning points! Earning a certain amount of in-game points means you will be ranked to a certain rank using the **Shop** GUI. Photoshopping evidence of your points or/and cheating is strictly prohibited and will result in severe consequences. The amounts of points you must acquire for each rank can be found below.

| Points |
