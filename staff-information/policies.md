## Points Policy
{:.text-red-300}
Thank you for purchasing points at BloxStreet - your donation is appreciated. As a thank you from us, you receive a rank, depending on the amount of points you used. 

**Please note the following:**
{:.text-red-000}
* Lying about rank purchases through points will result in a **permanent ban.** 
* Abusing will result in consequences. 
* You still need to follow all of our rules. If you don't, you'll be subject to the same moderation action as everyone else, including demotions, blacklists, and permanent bans.

## Reclaiming Policy
{:.text-red-300}
If you have been **demoted** or **blacklisted** for any reason, reclaiming a rank immediately after facing consequences will lead to a **permanent ban.** If you would like to appeal a staff blacklist, you may read more [here](https://support.bloxstreet.store/appeals/pbanandblacklist.html).

## Strike Policy
{:.text-red-300}
**Please note the following:**
{:.text-red-000}
* Only **Junior Moderator+** can hand out strikes. 
* Strikes are **permanent.** Once assigned, they cannot be removed.
* Receiving **three** strikes is a demotion one rank down. 
* If you get demoted, you are free to work your way back up! 

## Resignation Policy
{:.text-red-300}
Resignations are **FINAL** for ALL ranks. No reranks will be offered if you change your mind. Please think over resignations carefully. They are a big thing and you need to be certain. You **WON'T** be ranked back after you resign. Reranks are also not given to users who are demoted. 

Please keep in mind that SHRs **can** return to BloxStreet in certain circumstances. At the moment, this is not applicable. 

## Rank Transfer Policy 
{:.text-red-300}
As a staff member, you are allowed to transfer your rank onto another account. You may only do this once. If you wish to do so, create a ticket in the BloxStreet communications server. 

You cannot transfer your rank onto another account if you are hacked or banned by Roblox. 

## Hacked Policy 
{:.text-red-300}
BloxStreet does not offer rank transfers if your account has been hacked. We expect you to keep your account safe and secure. Your account is **100%** your responsibility.

If you are an MR or HR and your account is hacked, you **must** inform an SHR immediately.

## Investigation Policy
{:.text-red-300}
If an SHR is investigating a staff member or a community member, the SHR has the right to demote that staff member or community member to Customer until the investigation is complete. Additionally, the SHR has the right to remove any Discord role(s) from the staff member or community member while the investigation is on-going. The SHR can also take any action which is deemed necessary. Once the investigation is complete, the SHR will either rerank or take appropriate action on the player(s) involved. Additionally, SHRs who are investigating staff members or community members have the right to ask questions, which the staff member or community member must answer truthfully. Lastly, SHRs are not required to provide evidence to the staff members or community members being investigated.
