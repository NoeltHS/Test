## Strike Policy
{:.text-red-300}
**Please note the following:**
{:.text-red-000}
* The authority to issue strikes is limited to Junior Moderator+. It is important to note that strikes are permanent and cannot be removed once assigned.
* Receiving **three** strikes results in a demotion one rank down. However, this may vary in some cases.

## Resignation Policy
{:.text-red-300}
Once a staff member resigns, it is considered final. BloxStreet does not offer reranks if a player changes their mind after resigning. As a result, it is strongly advised that players carefully consider their decision to resign, as it is an irreversible action. However, it is important to note that SHRs have the possibility to return to BloxStreet under certain circumstances.

## Rank Transfer Policy 
{:.text-red-300}
Staff members are permitted to transfer their rank to a different account, but this action can only be performed once. If a staff member intends to transfer their rank, they should open a ticket in the BloxStreet communications server for assistance. It is important to note that a staff member must have access to both accounts. Please keep in mind that players who have been hacked or banned by Roblox are not permitted to transfer their rank to another account.

## Hacked Account Policy 
{:.text-red-300}
BloxStreet does not offer rank transfers in cases where an account has been hacked. It is the player's responsibility to ensure the safety and security of their account. Staff members are held fully accountable for the security of their own accounts. In the event that a staff member's account has been compromised, it is crucial for them to promptly inform an SHR through a ticket.

## Deleted Account Policy
{:.text-red-300}
Staff members whose accounts are deleted have the option to transfer their rank to a different account if their ban is deemed false by a Junior Moderator+. The Junior Moderator+ has the authority to assess whether it is appropriate for an individual's rank to be transferred to another account when their original account is deleted. We acknowledge that Roblox moderation can fall short of complete accuracy, and as a result, we provide individuals with the chance to transfer their rank to an alternate account if their main account gets deleted.

## Investigation Policy
{:.text-red-300}
In the event that an SHR is conducting an investigation into a community member, the SHR has the authority to temporarily demote the player to the rank of Customer until the investigation is concluded. Furthermore, the SHR has the right to remove any Discord roles from the player while the investigation is ongoing. Once the investigation is finalized, the SHR will take appropriate action or re-rank the player(s) involved. Moreover, SHRs who are conducting investigations have the right to pose questions to the individuals involved, and it is expected that those individuals respond truthfully. However, it is important to note that SHRs are not obligated to provide evidence to the players who are undergoing an investigation.

## Plagiarism Policy
{:.text-red-300}
Intentionally copying official BloxStreet materials, encompassing, but not limited to, our forms, guides, documents, server layout, GFX, and game, may lead to, at the very least, a termination, a staff blacklist, and/or a ban from the BloxStreet Discord server. Neglecting to report such plagiarism despite being aware can also lead to consequences. It is expected that establishments throughout Roblox foster originality, which prohibits the replication of BloxStreet's resources for personal gain.

## Refund Policy
{:.text-red-300}
BloxStreet has a strict no-refund policy for all purchases, regardless of the item or product, including points, in-game cash, and game passes. It is essential to keep this policy in mind before making any purchases.

## Alternate Account Policy
{:.text-red-300}
Staff members are allowed to utilize alternate accounts for roleplaying purposes as a Customer, LR, or MR. However, it is strictly prohibited for staff members to attain an HR rank through any means on their alternate accounts. Failure to adhere to BloxStreet's guidelines while using an alternate account will lead to consequences for both the main and alternate accounts. Furthermore, players who use an alternate account to bypass a blacklist or permanent ban will be permanently banned.
