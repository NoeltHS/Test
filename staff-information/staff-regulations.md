* Abusing admin, the staff panel, or any permissions will result in consequences. Refer to the [Punishment Guide](https://support.bloxstreet.store/guides/punishment-guide.html) for details. 
* Professionalism is required while in public eye. Team Leader+ should utilize proper grammar in all BloxStreet games. Behaving unprofessionally reflects badly on our group. We don't want to be known as a group that behaves unprofessionally.

* Don't intervene with Junior Moderator+ moderation. We know what we're doing, and minimods are not needed nor appreciated.
