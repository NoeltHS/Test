# Staff Regulations 
At BloxStreet, it is imperative that staff members abide by a set of regulations in order to enhance the overall shopping experience for our customers. Shown below is a list of conduct regulations that all staff members are obliged to comply with. Non-compliance with these regulations will lead to appropriate consequences. It is crucial to note that the rules outlined below represent only a fraction of the many guidelines that staff members are expected to observe. For a detailed understanding of the consequences associated with specific offenses, refer to the [Punishment Guide](https://support.bloxstreet.store/guides/punishment-guide.html).

## Uniforms

While on duty, it is mandatory for all staff members to wear an official BloxStreet uniform. Staff members can easily equip a uniform by interacting with a locker and selecting their preferred hoodie or shirt.
  
  Other information to note:
  *  Failure or refusal to comply with the requirement of wearing an official BloxStreet uniform while on duty will result in consequences.

## In-Game Conduct

  *  Maintaining professionalism is required while in the public eye. Staff members are expected to conduct themselves in a professional manner at all times, as their behavior directly reflects the reputation of our group.
  *  It is essential for LRs and MRs to remain focused and actively work while on duty at the store. Engaging in disruptive activities or behavior is strictly prohibited and will result in consequences. If a staff member desires to engage in conversations or take a break, they should switch to the off-duty mode.
  *  Staff members are expected to uphold a high level of professionalism both on and off duty. Any behavior that goes against BloxStreet's rules, regardless of whether it occurs when a staff member is on or off duty, will result in consequences.
  *  Staff members are prohibited from going idle in the middle of the store. If a staff member needs to go idle or take a break, they should respawn in the staff room by resetting their character. HRs are permitted to stand against a wall while AFK.
  *  LRs and MRs are strictly prohibited from interacting with individuals who troll or demonstrate disruptive behavior. In such situations, LRs and MRs must seek guidance from HRs, as HRs are aware of how to handle these specific circumstances.
  *  All staff members are expected to adhere to and promptly comply with any orders issued by an HR+. Failure to comply with such orders will lead to consequences.
  *  Abusing admin, the warning system, cuffs, or any privileges will result in consequences.

## General Conduct

  *  Staff members are required to respect the decisions made by SHRs. If a staff member has a question or concern about a decision made by an SHR, they may seek clarification by creating a ticket. SHRs will not reveal any confidential information.
  *  Regardless of who may be at fault in a given situation, staff members are expected to refrain from instigating or participating in any form of drama. If a staff member encounters an issue with another community member, they should report the issue to a Junior Moderator+ privately. Personal drama should be kept completely separate from the staff team.
  *  Administrative actions are considered final. Staff members are expected to follow these actions without exception. If a player has any questions or concerns regarding administrative action taken against them, they should create a ticket. Complaining or openly expressing discontent about administrative action will lead to further consequences.
  *  Staff members are expected to remain professional at both affiliated and non-affiliated establishments, as failing to do so will result in consequences.
  *  Professionalism must be maintained to a certain degree within the communications server. Staff members are more than welcome to converse with one another, but all topics must be appropriate and within reason.
