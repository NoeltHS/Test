## Table of Contents
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

1. TOC
{:toc}

The objective of this guide is to provide Store Manager+ with instructions on training sessions and offer guidance for effectively training Low Ranks.

* The text in *italics* is intended for trainers to say.
* The text in **bold** provides instructions on what trainers should do during training sessions.

## Training Behavior and Information
{: .text-red-300 }

* Trainers should avoid rushing through the script. Provide sufficient time for LRs to read and process the information being presented.
* MRs and HRs should refrain from engaging in conversations and instead utilize the communications server.
* Engaging in any form of unprofessional behavior will result in immediate dismissal from the session and potential disciplinary actions.
* It is acceptable for a trainer to claim another trainer's position if one disconnects prior to the teleportation of LRs.
* LRs are permitted to go AFK for a maximum duration of three minutes, although they must inform their trainer about their temporary absence. LRs are allowed to go AFK only twice per session.

## Rank Information
{: .text-red-300 }
Below is an overview of each rank's job at training sessions.

| Job        | Description          | Eligible Ranks | Quantity | 
|:-------------|:------------------|:------|:-------------------|
| Host | The Host should join the Training Center between :35 and :40 and claim the session using the GUI at :45. The Host assumes several key responsibilities in the training session, including leading the session and delivering the introduction. They are also responsible for verifying that trainers have the correct guide version, whitelisting trainers, supervising the session to ensure smooth operation, and ranking. | Board of Directors+ | **1** host per training |
| Co-Host | The Co-Host should join the Training Center between :35 and :40. The Co-Host contributes by doing the group shouts, verifying that trainers have the correct guide version, and recording training attendance using the appropriate format. Additionally, the Co-Host plays a key role in supervising the session, ensuring its smooth operation, and ranking. It is crucial for the Co-Host to accurately submit the training attendance in a ticket, adhering to the designated format. | Board of Directors+  | **1** co-host per training - an Executive Assistant+ may choose to host independently |
| Ranker           | The rankers of the session have the responsibility of ranking all LRs who have successfully completed the training. While it is not mandatory for rankers to be present for the entire session, they are expected to join approximately 10 minutes before ranking commences. However, they are also welcome to attend the entire session, supervising after the teleportation process, but before the actual ranking begins. Rankers have permission to help the training session Host and Co-Host with guide checking. They are allowed to perform guide checks independently, but whether they choose to do so or not depends on the agreement among the Host, Co-Host, and themselves. If rankers decide to conduct guide checks, they are required to remain present for the entire duration of the session. It is not acceptable for them to only join for guide checking, leave, and then rejoin later for ranking. The Host holds the responsibility of ensuring that the rankers are present during their session. This includes coordinating with the rankers and confirming their availability. | Executive Assistant+ | **2 or 3** rankers per training
| Announcer | The announcer is tasked with making the announcement about the training session in all large servers of the store. The selection of the announcer is made by the Host, who has the authority to choose an individual for this specific role. | Store Director+ | **1** announcer per training
| Trainer           | Trainers are expected to join the Training Center at :45 and carefully follow the instructions provided in this guide. Trainers conduct a series of tests and evaluate the performance of their LRs based on the criteria outlined in this guide. | Store Manager+ | Maximum of **16 trainers** (1 trainer per counter)  |
| Lower Ranks | Low Ranks (LRs), which are Trainee Team Members, Junior Team Members, and Senior Team Members, attend training sessions and must adhere to all instructions provided. By doing so, LRs have the opportunity to receive a possible promotion. | Trainee Team Member, Junior Team Member, and Senior Team Member | No maximum | 
| Spectators | Spectators supervise training sessions and ensure everything is running smoothly. | Junior Moderator+ | No maximum | 

## Host and Co-Host Scripts
{: .text-red-300 }
This section provides an overview of the responsibilities and duties assigned to the Host and Co-Host, as well as guidelines on what they should say.

### Host and Co-Host: Claiming
{: .text-yellow-200 }
{: .no_toc }

**Between :35 and :40**, it is expected that both the Host and Co-Host arrive at the Training Center to prepare for the training session. It is the responsibility of both the Host and Co-Host to ensure they are online and punctual for the session. Failing to attend a claimed session without giving a notice will result in a punishment (if done repetitively).

**At :45**, which is 15 minutes before the training session begins, the Host should claim the session, while the Co-Host does the first group shout to notify LRs. Simultaneously, the announcer is responsible for making an announcement about the training session in all large servers at the store. Furthermore, it is important for the Host, Co-Host, and/or rankers to request trainers to state two lines from the Cafe Test, ensuring that they have access to the correct version of the guide.

### Host and Co-Host: After Claiming
{: .text-yellow-200 }
{: .no_toc }

At this point, it is expected that the Host and Co-Host stand next to each other. As LRs join the server, the Host is required to repeatedly announce the following line:

**Host:** *Welcome to all of our staff members joining! Please enter the building and stand on the red lines. Your trainer will answer any questions you may have.*

The Host should announce the line below at :57. 

**Host:** *We will commence in approximately three minutes. All LRs should refrain from dancing and talking.* 

### Host and Co-Host: Training Commences
{: .text-yellow-200 }
{: .no_toc }

**At :00**, which is the exact time of the training session's commencement, the Host should type the command "/e :slock". The Co-Host should send the second group shout. Once all the LRs have become silent, the Host and Co-Host can proceed to deliver their introduction lines. In the event that any LRs fail to comply with the requirement to remain silent, the Host and Co-Host have the authority to remove them from the server. 

**Host:** *Greetings, everyone! Welcome to today’s training session! My name is (username), and I am your host.*

**Co-Host:** *Hello, everyone! My name is (username), and I am your co-host for today’s training session. I wish you the best of luck.*

**Co-Host:** *Before we commence, I ask everyone to remain silent at all times. You will be watching a presentation before being trained.*

**Host:** *The presentation lasts a few minutes, and we request that you give it your full attention. This presentation teaches you vital information for your success.*

**Co-Host:** *Please note that speaking or distracting others is prohibited during this time, and you will be removed from the server if caught doing so.* 

To initiate the presentation, the Host needs to click the 'Host Settings' button located at the bottom left corner of their screen. Afterward, the Host should proceed by clicking the 'Begin' button. In case the 'Host Settings' button is not visible in the bottom left corner, the Host should promptly rejoin the session. The slideshow can only be played once.

**Host:** *The presentation has started. If you wish to receive a closer view of the slideshow, click on a monitor.*

Throughout the presentation, both the Host and Co-Host should actively supervise the LRs to ensure they are adhering to the guidelines. This includes making sure that the LRs are remaining on the red lines and refraining from engaging in conversations with one another. In addition, the Host and/or Co-Host should remove Management Interns - Assistant Managers from the session.

### Host and Co-Host: After Presentation
{: .text-yellow-200 }
{: .no_toc }

**Host:** *Thank you for paying attention during the presentation. You will now receive further instructions about this training.*

**Co-Host:** *LRs, please remain on the red lines. You will be teleported to a trainer when one is available. Once you are teleported, you should NOT wander around.*

**Host:** *On behalf of all MRs and HRs here, I wish you the best of luck in passing this training session. Trainers, please be patient until your LRs are teleported to you.*

The Co-Host can now proceed to move towards the red lines, while the Host should head to the first occupied station for teleportation. To teleport LRs, the Host can view the Co-Host and bring the LRs. It is important to note that the Host should teleport a minimum of one and a maximum of four LRs to each trainer, depending on the number of trainers available.


## Trainer Scripts
{: .text-red-300 }
This section provides an overview of the tests that trainers are required to perform. In the event that an LR needs to go AFK, trainers should not wait for their return. The maximum AFK duration is three minutes, ensuring that the LR does not miss significant content if the trainer maintains an average pace. Upon the LR's return from being AFK, the trainer should provide a summary of the covered topics and perform any missed tests. However, if all LRs disconnect or fail the training session, the trainer should promptly leave the server without notifying the Host or Co-Host.


### Grammar/Greeting Test
{: .text-purple-100 }
{: .no_toc }

During the Grammar/Greeting Test, trainers are responsible for explaining the test's procedure to the LRs. It is crucial to ensure that all LRs state their greetings during the test. **IMPORTANT: Trainers should refrain from failing LRs for minor grammatical errors. If the greetings are understandable, the LRs should be passed.** If necessary, trainers can offer helpful tips to the LRs. Additionally, trainers should remind LRs to copy and paste their greetings, as it expedites the process for them. If an LR misspells 'BloxStreet' during the Greeting Test, the trainer should prompt the LR to repeat their greeting. In case the LR passes, the trainer can proceed to the next test. However, if the LR fails, the trainer must state the fail prompt and remove them from the server, citing the reason as "Failed."

### Cafe Test
{: .text-purple-100 }
{: .no_toc }

The subsequent phase of training is the Cafe Test. During this evaluation, LRs will be tasked with preparing an order. It is essential that LRs utilize understandable grammar throughout this test. Trainers must make sure that LRs are well-informed about the slush machine, its two available flavors, and how to select them using a cold cup. In the event that an LR prepares the wrong drink during the Cafe Test, the trainer should kindly repeat the order and request the correct drink again. If, after the reminder, the LR still serves the incorrect drink, the trainer should state the fail prompt and remove them from the server, indicating the reason as "Failed." For this test, LRs should utilize the POS system.

### Register Test
{: .text-purple-100 }
{: .no_toc }

The subsequent stage of training is the Register Test. During this evaluation, LRs will engage in roleplay, simulating the necessary steps to check out a customer. If any LRs are unsure of how to send a payment request, trainers should take the time to explain the process to them. It is imperative that LRs state a greeting and an outro, inquire about the desired form of payment, and remind the trainer to scan their card, all while employing understandable grammar. If an LR fails to meet these requirements, the trainer should state the fail prompt and remove them from the server, specifying the reason as "Failed."

### Passing LRs
{: .text-purple-100 }
{: .no_toc }

If a group of LRs successfully pass, the trainer should utilize the :ff command on them and take them to one of the designated purple/pink lines in the training room. Subsequently, the Host, Co-Host, or rankers will rank them before dismissing them from the game. However, if a player disconnects before receiving their rank despite passing the training, trainers should promptly contact an available Executive Assistant+ for further assistance.

### Training Process
{: .text-blue-000 }
{: .no_toc }

This section will provide trainers with the training script. It is essential not to modify this script. The use of emojis is permitted.

**The introduction takes place at the cafe counter.**

**Trainer:** *Hello, everyone! Thank you for attending this training session. My name is (username), and I will be your trainer for today.*

**Trainer:** *During this training, I will be teaching you the basics that every Low Rank should know. I will also be providing important information for your success.*

**Trainer:** *If you need to go AFK for any reason, please make sure to tell me. Failure to do so will result in a removal from the server.*

**Trainer:** *Please keep in mind that you may go AFK for up to three minutes. You cannot go AFK for a period of time longer than three minutes.*

**Trainer:** *If you do not return after three minutes, you will be removed from the server.*

**Trainer:** *You may only go AFK up to two times during this training session.*

**Trainer:** *If I happen to disconnect, please wait until I rejoin. Do NOT move to a different station.*

**Trainer:** *If you disconnect from the server, you may attend the next training session. The training schedule can be found in the staff room, which is located in the store.*

**Trainer:** *Does anyone have any questions? A response from every Trainee is mandatory.*

At this point, all LRs are required to respond. If they reply with a positive answer, trainers can proceed with the training. However, if any LRs have questions or concerns, trainers should take the time to address them until the LRs are ready to begin. Nevertheless, trainers also have the discretion to proceed if the questions are causing delays and slowing down the group's progress.

### Grammar / Greeting Test Script
{: .text-blue-000 }
{: .no_toc }

**This test takes place at the cafe counter.**

At this point, the Grammar/Greeting Test will begin. Read [this section](https://support.bloxstreet.store/guides/training-guide.html#grammargreeting-test) to learn how to perform it. 

**Trainer:** *We will start this training with the Grammar/Greeting Test.*

**Trainer:** *I would now like everyone to state their greeting. Failure to do so will result in a removal from the server.*

**Wait for all LRs to state their greetings.** 

**If their greetings are understandable, pass them. Trainers should not be strict. If one lacks understandable grammar, use the line below. If an LR spells 'BloxStreet' incorrectly, follow the procedure [here](https://support.bloxstreet.store/guides/training-guide.html#grammargreeting-test).**

**Trainer:** *Now that I have finished providing an explanation about our group's cafe system, please face your register.*

**Once all LRs face their cafe register, state the line below.**

**Trainer:** *We will now begin this test. I will approach each of you individually. When I do, be sure to state your greeting.*

**Approach the first LR. Wait for the LR to state their greeting. Begin the test once they do.**

At this point, all LRs are required to respond. If they reply with a positive answer, trainers can proceed with the training. However, if any LRs have questions or concerns, trainers should take the time to address them until the LRs are ready to begin. Nevertheless, trainers also have the discretion to proceed if the questions are causing delays and slowing down the group's progress.

**Note: This part is the in-test script.**

**Wait for their greeting.** *Hi, may I please check out my items?*

**Wait for them to say.** *Thank you!*

**If an LR claims their register is not working, check to see if they are signed into another register. If they are, have them sign out of the register. If not, have them roleplay the simulation. Trainers may not fail their LRs if the register is not functioning properly.**

**If they pass, proceed. If they fail, use the line below.**

**Trainer:** *Unfortunately, you have failed this training session due to (reason). You are always welcome to attend another session.*


### Passing LRs
{: .text-blue-000 }
{: .no_toc }

**Trainer:** *Congratulations to everyone who passed the Register Test! You have each completed all tests, meaning we can now conclude this training.*

**State the line below if there is at least one Senior Team Member remaining in your group.**

**Trainer:** *If you are currently a Senior Team Member, you will be promoted to Management Intern. In order to be promoted as a Management Intern, you must attend and be recognized at a shift.*

**Trainer:** *Shifts are hosted daily at the store. The entire schedule can be found in the store's staff room.*

**Trainer:** *If you have any further questions, be sure to join our communications server. The code is ‘bloxstreet’.*

**Trainer:** *Please follow me to the purple ranking line so you can be ranked. Congratulations on passing!*

**Trainers should FF their LRs by executing the command :ff (username). Trainers must hide their commands by utilizing the command bar or placing an "/e" before any command.**

**Trainer:** *Stay online until the ranker dismisses you and says that you have been ranked. It has been a pleasure training you!*

Rankers should run the :info command on each LR before kicking. Running the command ensures each LR has been ranked correctly.

After guiding their LRs to a purple ranking line, trainers should leave the Training Center promptly. They should not wait until after their LRs have been ranked. However, if an SHR determines that a photo will take place, trainers should proceed to the lobby, find a seat/stand and **remain silent**, and follow the SHR's instructions accordingly.


## Training Conclusion
{: .text-red-300 }
Upon the completion of the training session, there should be no LRs remaining, and only a few HRs should be present. It is crucial for all trainers to leave the server once their training duties are fulfilled. In case there are any players still lingering, encourage them to head to the store. **Nothing else should be happening after training sessions. Photos for the Host, Co-Host, and rankers only are not permitted after training sessions**. If there is an abundance of players remaining in the server, an SHR should initiate a shutdown or run the command :place all.

The Co-Host should send the final group shout and submit the training attendance through a ticket.
