## Host Scripts
{: .text-red-300 }
This section outlines the duties the Host has and what they should say.

### Host: Claiming
{: .text-yellow-200 }
{: .no_toc }

At :35, the Host and the Co-Host should join the Training Center to prepare for the session. Trainers (Store Managers and HRs) may not join until :45.

To claim the session, click the message at the top of the screen that says “Click here to host one!”. A GUI will pop up with a button that says “Claim” on it. **Please read the information first on that GUI.** Once the “Claim” button is activated, the message that says “No training is being hosted right now. Check back later!” on the screen will be removed, and the session will become active.

At :45, the Co-Host should do the first shout on the group page. The group shout templates are located in a designated area. 

**_Note: Once the Host has claimed in-game, they should not leave the server, or they will receive consequences. The Host should not claim if they know they are experiencing technical difficulties._** 


### Host: After Claiming
{: .text-yellow-200 }
{: .no_toc }

As the LRs join the server, be sure to encourage them to enter the building and stand on the red lines.

**Host:** *Welcome to all of our staff members joining! Please enter the building and stand on the red lines. Your trainer will answer any questions that you might have.*

Make sure to state the line above until the start time. Do not spam it.
The Host and Co-Host should stand on their designated line. LRs are expected to enter the building and stand on the red lines.

Between claiming the session (:45) and the commencement of it (:00), the Host or Co-Host must approach each trainer and ask if they have the correct/updated version of the training guide.

**Host:** *We will commence in approximately three minutes. All LRs should refrain from dancing and talking.* 

The Host should say the line above at :57. 

### Host/Co-Host: Training Starts
{: .text-yellow-200 }
{: .no_toc }

At :00, the LRs should quietly stand on the red lines, and the MRs/HRs should be at their stations. The Host should use /e :slock to stop more LRs from joining, and the Co-Host should post the second group shout. The group shout templates are located in a designated area.

**Host:** *Greetings, everyone! Welcome to today’s training session! My name is (username), and I am your host.*

**Co-Host:** *Hello, everyone! My name is (username), and I am your co-host for today’s training session. I wish you the best of luck.*

**Co-Host:** *Before we commence, I ask everyone to remain silent at all times. You will be watching a presentation before being trained.*

**Host:** *The presentation lasts a few minutes, and we request that you give it your full attention. This presentation teaches you vital information for your success.*

**Co-Host:** *Please note that speaking or distracting others is prohibited during this time, and you will be removed from the server if caught doing so.* 

The host and co-host will stand and monitor the LRs and the presentation to ensure everything runs smoothly.

To begin the presentation, the Host must press the “Host Settings” button at the bottom left corner of their screen, and then press the button that says ‘Begin’. **If the “Host Settings” button is not appearing on the bottom left corner, the Host should rejoin immediately. The slideshow can only be played once.**

**Host:** The presentation has started. If you wish to receive a closer view of the slideshow, click on a monitor.


### Host/Co-Host: After Presentation
{: .text-yellow-200 }
{: .no_toc }

Once the presentation concludes, LRs are required to remain silent for the host’s instructions.

**Host:** *Thank you for paying attention during the presentation. You will now receive further instructions about this training.*

**LRs will continue standing on the red lines after the presentation has concluded.**

**Co-Host:** *LRs, please remain on the red lines. You will be teleported to a trainer when one is available. Once you are teleported, you should NOT wander around.*

**Host:** *On behalf of all MRs and HRs here, I wish you the best of luck in passing this training session. Trainers, please be patient until your LRs are teleported to you.*

**At this point, the Host will teleport four LRs to each trainer. Try to keep an eye on where the LRs are to ensure you do not teleport someone currently being trained.**

**Anybody who decides to idle during training should be kicked.**


## Trainer Scripts
{: .text-red-300 }
This section will outline each of the tests the trainers are expected to perform. If an LR has to go AFK, the trainer should not wait for them to return. The AFK limit is three minutes, meaning the LR should not miss too much if the trainer is going at an average pace. When the LR returns from being AFK, the trainer should summarize the topic(s) that were covered. Additionally, the trainer should conduct the test(s) missed. If all LRs disconnect or fail the training session, leave the server immediately. There is no need to notify the Host or Co-Host. 


### Grammar/Greeting Test
{: .text-purple-100 }
{: .no_toc }

For the Grammar/Greeting Test, trainers must explain how this test works. Make sure to have all LRs state their greetings. **IMPORTANT: Do not fail LRs for minor grammatical errors. If their greetings are understandable, pass them.** Feel free to give out tips if needed. Make sure to remind them to copy and paste their greeting, as it makes things much quicker on their behalf. If an LR spells ‘BloxStreet’ incorrectly during the Greeting Test, the trainer should tell the LR to repeat their greeting. If they pass, move on to the next test. If they fail, state the fail prompt and kick them from the server with the reason "Failed." 

### Cafe Test
{: .text-purple-100 }
{: .no_toc }

The next part of training is the Cafe Test. In this test, LRs will be asked to prepare an order. LRs must utilize understandable grammar in this test. Ensure that LRs are aware of how the slush machine works and that it has two flavors that can be selected with a cold cup. If an LR gets the wrong drink during the Cafe Test, the trainer should repeat the order and request the drink again. If the LR still brings the incorrect drink, state the fail prompt and kick them from the server with the reason "Failed." For this test, LRs should use the POS system.

### Register Test
{: .text-purple-100 }
{: .no_toc }

The next part of training is the Register Test. In this test, LRs will roleplay a series of steps required in order to check someone out. If they do not know how to send a payment request, explain the process to them. Make sure they state a greeting and outro, ask what the desired form of payment is, and remind the trainer to scan their card, all while utilizing understandable grammar. If they fail, state the fail prompt and kick them from the server with the reason "Failed."

### Passing LRs
{: .text-purple-100 }
{: .no_toc }

If the group of LRs pass, the trainer should use the :ff command on them, and take them to one of the purple/pink lines in the training room. The Host/Co-Host will rank them accordingly and then kick them from the game. If a player disconnects before getting ranked but has passed the training, contact an available Executive Assistant+. The ranker should ask an available SHR for ranking permission.

### Training Process
{: .text-blue-000 }
{: .no_toc }

This section will provide trainers with the training script. Do not modify this script. The use of emojis is permitted.

**The introduction takes place at the cafe counter.**

**Trainer:** *Hello, everyone! Thank you for attending this training session. My name is (username), and I will be your trainer for today.*

**Trainer:** *During this training, I will be teaching you the basics that every Low Rank should know. I will also be providing important information for your success.*

**Trainer:** *If you need to go AFK for any reason, please make sure to tell me. Failure to do so will result in a removal from the server.*

**Trainer:** *Please keep in mind that you may go AFK for up to three minutes. You cannot go AFK for a period of time longer than three minutes.*

**Trainer:** *If you do not return after three minutes, you will be removed from the server.*

**Trainer:** *You may only go AFK up to two times during this training session.*

**Trainer:** *If I happen to disconnect, please wait until I rejoin. Do NOT move to a different station.*

**Trainer:** *If you disconnect from the server, you may attend the next training session. The training schedule can be found in the staff room, which is located in the store.*

**Trainer:** *Does anyone have any questions? A response from every Trainee is mandatory.*

At this point, all LRs must respond. If they reply with a positive answer, implying that they are ready to proceed, move on. If not, answer any questions they may have until they are ready to begin. Trainers have a right to proceed if the questions are slowing the group down. 

### Grammar / Greeting Test Script
{: .text-blue-000 }
{: .no_toc }

**This test takes place at the cafe counter.**

At this point, the Grammar/Greeting Test will begin. Read [this section](https://support.bloxstreet.store/guides/training-guide.html#grammargreeting-test) to learn how to perform it.

**Trainer:** *When a guest approaches your register at the store, you must greet them with a polite greeting.*

**Trainer:** *Here is an example of a greeting: “Hello! Welcome to BloxStreet Shopping Center! My name is (username), how may I assist you today?”*

**Trainer:** *You are welcome to add adjectives or emojis to your greeting. Feel free to customize it to your liking.*

**Trainer:** *I would now like everyone to state their greeting. Failure to do so will result in a removal from the server.*

**Wait for all LRs to state their greetings.** 

**_If their greetings are understandable, pass them. Do not be strict. If they lack understandable grammar, use the line below. If an LR spells 'BloxStreet' incorrectly, follow the procedure under 'Grammar/Greeting Test.'_**

**Trainer:** *Unfortunately, you have failed this training session due to a lack of understandable grammar in your greeting. You are always welcome to attend another session.*


### Cafe Test Script

**This test takes place at the cafe counter.**

**Trainer:** *Congratulations, you have all passed the Greeting Test! We will now move on to the Cafe Test.*

**Trainer:** *In this test, treat me as a guest who has approached your cafe register.*

**Trainer:** *You must utilize understandable grammar in this test. I will determine if your grammar is understandable or not.*

**Trainer:** *Before we begin, I will show you how to make a coffee. Please pay attention and avoid going AFK, as the information is vital for your success.*

**Trainer:** *Firstly, click on the mug. Once you have equipped the mug, dispense the type of coffee the customer ordered. I will show you an example, so please watch closely.*

**At this point, show them how to make a simple coffee.**

**Trainer:** *We also have a slush machine at BloxStreet that allows our guests to choose from two flavored slushies.*

**Trainer:** *This machine requires a COLD CUP.*

**Trainer:** *To dispense a slush, simply place the COLD CUP under the desired flavor.*

**At this point, take your LRs back to the cafe counter.**

**Trainer:** *To use the POS system, scan your BloxStreet Staff Card on the screen to sign in.*

**Trainer:** *Once signed in, scan any items the customer has ordered, and click "Finish Transaction." The customer will be required to tap their Cash Card on the reader.*

**Trainer:** *If the payment is declined, you cannot serve the customer, as they cannot afford what they ordered.*

**Trainer:** *If this occurs, remove the items from the order or press "Void Transaction."*

**Trainer:** *Be sure to sign out once you are finished. Never leave a terminal signed in.*

**Trainer:** *Now that you have seen how to make drinks, it is time for you to have a turn. If you need assistance in this test, you are welcome to ask me.*

**Trainer:** *We will now begin this test. I will approach each of you individually. When I do, be sure to state your greeting.*

**Approach the first LR. Wait for the LR to state their greeting. Begin the test once they do.**

**Trainer:**  *Hi! Could I get a Regular Coffee and a Cherry Slush?*

**Assist the LR as needed. Follow the procedure [here](https://support.bloxstreet.store/guides/training-guide.html#cafe-test) if an LR gives the wrong order.**

{: .text-red-100 }
If they say yes, begin. If they say no, answer any questions until they are ready. Note that trainers have a right to proceed if the questions are slowing the group down.


**Note: This part is the in-test script.**

**Wait for their greeting.** *Hi, may I please check out my items?*

**Wait for them to say.** *Thank you!*

**_If an LR claims their register is not working, check to see if they are signed into another register. If they are, have them sign out of the register. If not, have them roleplay the simulation. Trainers may not fail their LRs if the register is not functioning properly._**

**_If they pass, proceed. If they fail, use the line below._**

**Trainer:** *Unfortunately, you have failed this training session due to (reason). You are always welcome to attend another session.*


### Passing LRs
{: .text-blue-000 }
{: .no_toc }

**Trainer:** *Congratulations to everyone who passed the Register Test! You have each completed all tests, meaning we can now conclude this training.*

**Trainer:** *If you have any further questions, be sure to join our communications server. The code is ‘bloxstreet’.*

**Trainer:** *Please follow me to the purple ranking line so you can be ranked. Congratulations on passing!*

**Trainers should FF their LRs by executing the command :ff (username). Trainers must hide their commands by utilizing the command bar or placing a "/e" before any command.**

**Trainer:** *Stay online until the ranker dismisses you and says that you have been ranked. It has been a pleasure training you!*

**Rankers should run the :info command on each LR before kicking. Running the command ensures each LR has been ranked correctly.**

**Trainers should leave the Training Center after taking their LRs to a purple ranking line. Trainers should not wait until after their LRs have been ranked. However, if an SHR decides a photo will be taking place, trainers may head to the lobby and follow their directions.**


## Training Conclusion
{: .text-red-300 }
Once the training has ended, there should be no LRs remaining and very few HRs. All trainers must leave the server after they have finished training. If there are players left, encourage them to head to the store. Nothing else should be happening after training sessions. Providing in-game feedback is unnecessary. Have an SHR shutdown or run :place all if there are many players remaining in the server.

Leave the server when finished training. Trainers should not do anything else unless instructed otherwise by an SHR. 

At the end of training, the Co-Host should post the last group shout. The group shout templates are located in a designated area.
