* To host a training, you must claim a session one day before the day you want to host. You do not need to be in the game until :35. Trainers (Store Managers and HRs) should not join until the session has been claimed by the host. When in-game, make sure to use the GUI to set yourself as the Host.

* Trainers will answer any inquiries from LRs once teleportation has been completed.
* Once the host claims using the GUI, all trainers are required to go inside the Training Center and find an available counter. Low Ranks should enter the building and stand on the red lines.
* Hosts are required to select a trusted HR to announce training at the store. The announcer should announce the training session in **all** large servers of the store.
* Trainers should not rush through the script. Allow your LRs to have time to read the information you’re providing them. 
* Trainers and hosts should not be chatting or joking around with each other during the training session and before LRs join. 
* If trainers and hosts need to chat, they should do so in the communications server, not in-game.
* Each LR may only go AFK for up to three minutes. Each LR may only go AFK up to two times per training session.
* LRs should use the handto system during the Cafe Test.

## Host Scripts
{: .text-red-300 }
This section outlines what the duties the host has and what they should say. Do not follow this section if you are not the Host/Co-Host.

### Host: Claiming
{: .text-yellow-200 }
{: .no_toc }

At :35, the Host, the Co-Host, and the rankers should join the Training Center to prepare for the session. Trainers (Store Managers and HRs) should not join until :45.

To claim the session, click the message at the top of the screen that says “Click here to host one!”. A GUI will pop up with a button that says “Claim” on it. **Please read the information first on that GUI.** Once you have pressed "Claim," the message that says “No training is being hosted right now. Check back later!” on the screen will be removed, and the session will become active. 

At :45, the Co-Host should do the first shout on the group page. The group shout templates are located in a designated area. 

**_Note: After you have claimed in-game, you cannot leave the server, or you will receive consequences! Do not claim if you know you are having internet related issues, that might mean you get disconnected, etc._** 


### Host: After Claiming
{: .text-yellow-200 }
{: .no_toc }

As the LRs join the server, be sure to encourage them to enter the building and stand on the red lines.

**Host:** *Welcome to all of our staff members joining! Please enter the building and stand on the red lines. Your trainer will answer any questions that you might have.*

You should keep saying the line above until the start time. Do not spam it.
The Host and Co-Host should stand on their designated line. LRs are expected to enter the building and stand on the red lines.

**Host:** *We will commence in approximately three minutes. All LRs should refrain from dancing and talking.* 

The Host should say the line above at :57. 

### Host/Co-Host: Training Starts
{: .text-yellow-200 }
{: .no_toc }

At :00, the LRs should quietly stand on the red lines, and the MRs/HRs should be at their stations. The Host should use /e :slock to stop more LRs from joining, and the Co-Host should post the second group shout. The group shout templates are located in a designated area. **Additionally, the Host or Co-Host must approach each trainer and ask if they have the correct/updated version of the training guide (Trivia Test and removal of the explanations).**

**Host:** *Greetings, everyone! Welcome to today’s training session! My name is (username), and I am your host.*

**Co-Host:** *Hello, everyone! My name is (username), and I am your co-host for today’s training session. I wish you the best of luck.*

**Co-Host:** *Before we commence, I ask everyone to remain silent at all times. You will be watching a presentation before being trained.*

**Host:** *The presentation lasts a few minutes, and we request that you give it your full attention. This presentation teaches you vital information for your success.*

**Co-Host:** *Please note that speaking or distracting others is prohibited during this time, and you will be removed from the server if caught doing so.* 

The host and co-host will stand and monitor the LRs and the presentation to ensure everything runs smoothly.

To begin the presentation, the Host must press the “Host Settings” button at the bottom left corner of their screen, and then press the button that says ‘Begin’. **If the “Host Settings” button is not appearing on the bottom left corner, the Host should rejoin immediately. The slideshow can only be played once.**

**Host:** The presentation has started. If you wish to receive a closer view of the slideshow, click on a monitor.


### Host/Co-Host: After Presentation
{: .text-yellow-200 }
{: .no_toc }

Once the presentation concludes, LRs are required to remain silent for the host’s instructions.

**Host:** *Thank you for paying attention during the presentation. You will now receive further instructions about this training.*

**LRs will continue standing on the red lines after the presentation has concluded.**

**Co-Host:** *LRs, please remain on the red lines. You will be teleported to a trainer when one is available. Once you are teleported, you should NOT wander around.*

**Host:** *On behalf of all MRs and HRs here, I wish you the best of luck in passing this training session. Trainers, please be patient until your LRs are teleported to you.*

**At this point, the Host will teleport LRs to trainers. Try to keep an eye on where the LRs are to ensure you don’t teleport someone currently being trained.**

**Anybody who decides to idle during training should be kicked.**


## Trainer Scripts
{: .text-red-300 }
This section will outline each of the tests the trainers are expected to perform.

### Grammar/Greeting Test
{: .text-purple-100 }
{: .no_toc }

For the Grammar/Greeting Test, as a trainer, you must explain how this test works. Have your group of LRs show their greetings to you. **IMPORTANT: Do not fail LRs for minor grammatical errors. If you can understand their greetings easily, you should pass them.** You are always welcome to give out tips if needed. Make sure to remind them to copy and paste their greeting every time, as it makes things much quicker on their behalf. If an LR spells ‘BloxStreet’ incorrectly during the Greeting Test, the trainer should tell the LR to repeat their greeting. If they pass, move on to the next test. If they fail, kick them from the server and explain why. 

### Cafe Test
{: .text-purple-100 }
{: .no_toc }

The next part of training is the Cafe Test. In this test, you will ask your LRs for any available drink. LRs must have understandable grammar in this test. Ensure that LRs know about the slush machine and that it has two flavors that can be selected with a cold cup. If an LR gets the wrong drink during the Cafe Test, the trainer should repeat the order and request the drink again. If the LR still brings the incorrect drink, you may fail them. For this test, LRs should use the handto system.

### Register Test
{: .text-purple-100 }
{: .no_toc }

The next part of training is the Register Test. In this test, you will go through a roleplay of your LRs checking you out. If they don’t know how to send a payment request, explain the process to them. Make sure they state a greeting and outro, ask what your payment preference is, and remind you to scan your card, all while utilizing understandable grammar. If they fail, explain why when kicking them from the server.

### Trivia
{: .text-purple-100 }
{: .no_toc }

The final part of training is Trivia. In this section of the training, trainers are required to quiz their LRs on topics covered in the presentation and in the training itself. This part tests an LR’s knowledge on BloxStreet and whether or not they were paying attention during the presentation.

### Passing LRs
{: .text-purple-100 }
{: .no_toc }

If your LRs pass, you must use the :ff command on them, and take them to one of the purple/pink lines in the training room. The Host/Co-Host will rank them accordingly and then kick them from the game. If a player disconnects before getting ranked but has passed the training, the host should ask an available SHR for ranking permission.

### Training Process
{: .text-blue-000 }
{: .no_toc }

This section will provide the script for trainers to use. Please try to stick to this layout. You may add emojis. 

**The introduction takes place at the cafe counter.**

**Trainer:** *Hello, everyone! Thank you for attending this training session. My name is (username), and I will be your trainer for today.*

**Trainer:** *During this training, I will be teaching you the basics that every Low Rank should know. I will also be providing important information for your success.*

**Trainer:** *If you need to go AFK for any reason, please make sure to tell me. Failure to do so will result in a removal from the server.*

**Trainer:** *Please keep in mind that you may go AFK for up to three minutes. You cannot go AFK for a period of time longer than three minutes.*

**Trainer:** *If you do not return after three minutes, you will be removed from the server.*

**Trainer:** *You may only go AFK up to two times during this training session.*

**Trainer:** *If I happen to disconnect, please wait until I rejoin. Do NOT move to a different station.*

**Trainer:** *If you disconnect from the server, you may attend the next training session. The training schedule can be found in the staff room, which is located in the store.*

**Trainer:** *Does anyone have any questions? A response from every Trainee is mandatory.*

At this point, you must wait for the Trainee to respond. If they reply with a positive answer, implying that they are ready to proceed, move on. If not, answer any questions they may have until they are ready to begin.

**Trainer:** *You must utilize understandable grammar in this test. I will determine if your grammar is understandable or not.*

**Trainer:** *Before we begin, I will show you how to make a coffee. Please pay attention, and avoid going AFK, as the information is vital for your success.*

**Trainer:** *Firstly, click on the mug. Once you have equipped the mug, dispense the type of coffee the customer ordered. I’ll show you an example, please watch closely.*

### Trivia Script
{: .text-blue-000 }
{: .no_toc }

**This test takes place at the cafe station.**

**Trainer:** *Congratulations, you have all passed the Register Test! As there are no more questions, we will move on to the final section of this training, Trivia.*

**Take your LRs to your station’s cafe counter.**

**Trainer:** *In this section, you will be required to answer six questions. All topics you are being quizzed on were covered during the presentation or during this training.*

**Trainer:** *All LRs are required to answer by typing in the chat. Copying someone else’s answers will not always lead you to the correct answer.*

**Trainer:** *Signs of plagiarism in answers will result in an automatic fail.*

**Trainer:** *All LRs must correctly answer at least four out of the six questions. You are welcome to use any BloxStreet sources.*

**Trainer:** *All LRs are required to answer each question within a span of 30 seconds. If you do not answer a question once 30 seconds has passed, you will not receive a point for the question.*

**Trainer:** *Before I begin, does anyone have any questions? This is your final opportunity to ask questions related to Trivia.*

**Answer any and all questions related to Trivia.**

**Trainer:** *Great! We will now begin. Firstly, when you are on a computer, how do you hand medicine to a guest?*

**State the answer line once everyone has finished answering, not after each LR has answered. Each LR's answer does not need to be exact.**

**Trainer:** *In order to hand medicine to a guest when on a computer, staff members should **_click ‘H’ on their keyboard_** and enter the player’s username.*

**Keep in mind the players who got the question correct or incorrect.**

**Trainer:** *In BloxStreet’s sandwich shop, how do you receive access to the bread?*

**State the answer line once everyone has finished answering, not after each LR has answered. Each LR's answer does not need to be exact.**

**Trainer:** *In order to receive access to the bread in BloxStreet’s sandwich shop, staff members should **_click on the cutting board_** once.*

**State the answer line once everyone has finished answering, not after each LR has answered. Each LR's answer does not need to be exact.**

**Trainer:** *In order to restock an empty shelf after equipping a box, staff members should first approach the shelf. After doing so, **_hold on ‘E’_** for a few seconds to restock.*

**Keep in mind the players who got the question correct or incorrect. If a player gets three or more questions incorrect, you may remove them from the server.**

**Trainer:** *In order to clean spills, you are required to grab a mop. Where in the store are the mops located?*

**State the answer line once everyone has finished answering, not after each LR has answered. Each LR's answer does not need to be exact.**

**Trainer:** *Trollers must be **_server banned_**. Trollers do not receive warnings or kicks. Instead of handling a troller yourself, contact an HR.*

**Keep in mind the players who got the question correct or incorrect. If a player gets three or more questions incorrect, you may remove them from the server.**

**Trainer:** *If no HR is in-game to handle a troller, what is the best way to contact one? Keep in mind that the group wall is not the best way.*

**State the answer line once everyone has finished answering, not after each LR has answered. Each LR's answer does not need to be exact.**

**Trainer:** *If no HR is in-game to handle a troller, the best way to contact one would be by pinging or messaging an available one through **_the communications server_**.*

### Passing LRs
{: .text-blue-000 }
{: .no_toc }

**Trainer:** *Congratulations to everyone who passed the Trivia Test! You have each completed all tests, meaning we can now conclude this training.*

**Trainer:** *If you have any further questions, be sure to join our communications server. The code is ‘bloxstreet’.*

**Trainer:** *Please follow me to the purple ranking line so you can be ranked. Congratulations on passing!*

**Trainers should FF their LRs by executing the command :ff (username). Trainers should hide their commands.**

**Trainer:** *Stay online until the ranker dismisses you and says that you have been ranked. It has been a pleasure training you!*

**Rankers should run the :info command on each LR after ranking and before kicking. Running the command ensures each LR has been ranked correctly.**

**Trainers should leave the Training Center after taking their LRs to a purple ranking line. Trainers should not wait until after their LRs have been ranked. However, if an SHR decides a photo will be taking place, trainers should not leave and head to the lobby instead.**


## Training Conclusion
{: .text-red-300 }
Once the training has ended, there should be no LRs remaining and very few HRs. All trainers must leave the server after they have finished training. If there are people left, encourage them to go to the store. Absolutely nothing else should be happening after training sessions. Do not sit around giving feedback as it is unnecessary. Have an SHR do :place all if there are a lot of people still in the server or just shutdown.


Leave the game when finished training or once you have been ranked. Do not do anything else.


At the end of training, the Co-Host should post the last group shout. The group shout templates are located in a designated area. 


If a Junior Moderator+ chooses to take a photo at the conclusion of the session, follow their directions.
