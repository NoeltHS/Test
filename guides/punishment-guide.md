Below is a compilation of BloxStreet's punishments. Certain punishments only pertain to staff, while others are applicable to all community members.

Note the following:
- Higher ranks may be subject to more severe punishments.
- All punishments are subject to change depending on the severity of the community member's actions.
- Lack of awareness regarding the rules does not exempt an individual from receiving a punishment.
- Certain punishments designated for staff members may also be applicable to non-staff.
- Not all punishments are explicitly listed in this document. It is expected that community members exercise common sense.
