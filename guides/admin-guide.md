#### 1B - Executing Commands
{: .text-grey-dk-000 }
{: .no_toc }
When executing commands, it is important to ensure that they are being used correctly and appropriately.

* To hide commands, you can use the "/e" prefix before typing them in the chat.
  * To execute a command privately using the "/e" method, simply open the chat and enter the command as usual. Once entered, place an "/e" before the desired command to ensure it is hidden.
    * EX:  **_/e :m Hello!_**
* In addition to using the chat, the console can also be utilized to execute commands.
  * To access the console, simply press the ";" or "'" key on your keyboard. This action will display a GUI at the top of your screen. Unlike using commands in the chat, the console does not require a prefix before entering the command.
    * EX: ; (Console Opens) 
      
      **_exploitlogs_**

      (Exploit logs GUI is then shown as expected) 
      
### Anti-Exploit
{: .text-red-300 }
TSA features an integrated anti-exploit system that prevents many exploiters. This system automatically takes appropriate actions, such as issuing permanent bans or kicks, based on the severity of the exploit detected.

* The :exploitlogs command allows you to view a log of detected exploits within the TSA system. It's important to note that the command does not provide real-time information about exploiters currently in the server or their ongoing activities. The system primarily logs instances where an exploiter has been automatically banned. However, it's crucial to understand that the system may not detect every exploiter, as some may go unnoticed. The exploit logs primarily serve as a record of past instances where the anti-exploit system has taken action.
* If a player appears in :exploitlogs, it indicates that the individual has been banned by TSA's anti-exploit system. In such cases, there is no need to request immediate in-game assistance, as the system has already taken appropriate action. However, if you encounter an exploiter in the game and they are not yet listed in :exploitlogs, it is recommended to contact an available HR. Make an effort to gather sufficient evidence of the exploiter, such as screenshots or videos, and then proceed to open a ticket.

### Downtime
{: .text-red-300 }
Downtime refers to a period when a critical error occurs within the code, resulting in the interruption of all command executions.

Click [here](https://status.bloxstreet.store) to view the status of various TSA services.

* During such instances of downtime, it is kindly requested by moderators that players refrain from spam pinging or repeatedly sending direct messages to them or anyone else. Engaging in such behavior can result in consequences. It is important to understand that the Group Developers are likely aware of the issues and are actively working to resolve them.
* If you encounter issues while playing, a simple solution may be to rejoin the server. However, if a large number of players simultaneously rejoin the server, it can potentially overload the system and cause delays in admin loading. To prevent such issues, it is requested that players exercise patience and wait a few minutes before attempting to rejoin the server.

### Acceptable Usage
