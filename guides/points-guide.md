BloxStreet provides players with an alternative to ranking up, which is through our points system. Players may earn points by completing certain tasks or purchasing them with Robux. Players who are planning to/have already purchased points are strongly encouraged to read through this guide carefully.

## Prior to earning or purchasing points, here are some things to keep in mind:
{: .text-red-300 }

- Lying about rank purchases or faking evidence of purchased points will result in a permanent ban.
- Abusing rank privileges will result in consequences.
- Claiming a rank through the points system will decrease a playerâ€™s chances of future promotions. The higher the rank purchased, the lower the chances of a promotion will be. SHRs encourage players to work their way up through hard work and dedication instead.
- Players must abide by all rules and regulations, regardless of whether they purchased a rank or not. Those who fail to abide by all guidelines will be subject to the same moderation action as everyone else, including demotions, blacklists, and permanent bans.
