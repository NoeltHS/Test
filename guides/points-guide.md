At BloxStreet, we offer players an alternative method to advance their ranks, and that is by utilizing our points system. Points can be acquired by accomplishing specific tasks or by purchasing them with Robux. We highly recommend players who intend to or have already bought points to thoroughly review this guide. 

## Points Policy
{: .text-red-300 }

* Fabricating evidence of acquired points will lead to a permanent ban.
* Engaging in the abuse of rank privileges will lead to consequences.
* All players, irrespective of whether they purchased a rank, are required to adhere to all rules and regulations. Any individual who fails to comply with the guidelines will face identical moderation actions as others, which may include demotions, blacklists, and permanent bans.

## Points Clarifications/Regulations
{: .text-red-300 }

* Reclaiming ranks is strictly prohibited and will lead to a permanent ban. However, all players, including previously blacklisted and banned individuals and reformed and resigned HRs, are allowed to utilize their points to claim a rank that they haven't previously acquired.
* LRs and MRs who have been previously demoted are permitted to reuse points to claim a rank they have not claimed previously.
* Players who claim ranks through the points system do not face a cooldown period if they choose to work their way up through points. However, players who have previously acquired a rank and are seeking a promotion by getting recognized are subject to cooldowns.
* Blacklisted players may not use the points system until their appeal is accepted. Doing so will result in a permanent ban.
* Players may not partake in any act of point cheating/grinding, as doing so will result in a demotion to Customer. Examples of point cheating/grinding include but are not limited to:

  * Using an alternate account in an attempt to obtain points
  * Joining a small server in an attempt to grind tasks
  * Taking items off of a shelf and restocking them shortly after
  * Completing tasks when simply unnecessary (ie: running around the store and waiting until a shelf is empty)

If a player is found violating any of the regulations above, inform an HR immediately. Note that attempting to find loopholes around any of the regulations above is prohibited and will result in severe consequences.
