{: .text-red-300 }

- There can only be **one** host for each shift.
- Arguing over shifts is not allowed.
- No shifts should be claimed 10 minutes after their designated start time.
- Executive Assistant or higher may rank for shifts.
- At the beginning of a shift, the host is responsible for making an announcement in-game using the BloxStreet Staff Panel. The announcement should be the group shout.
- During shifts, hosts should not have helpers or spectators following them.
- There is a maximum of 5 Management Interns, Team Leaders, Store Supervisors, and Assistant Managers promoted at each shift.
- Store Managers cannot receive a promotion during a shift, but they are still encouraged to work during them.
- All players who may be promoted at a shift should be checked to see if they are on cooldown.
- Please make sure to promote players who present outstanding grammar. Staff members who do not utilize proper grammar should not be considered for a promotion. Be sure to check the chatlogs and see the player's grammar.

## Joining & Leaving during a Shift
{: .text-red-300 }
- Before claiming a shift, make sure you have a good internet connection and can remain at the store for at least 35 minutes.
- Each shift lasts for 30 minutes. If you know you cannot stay for the entire shift, do not claim it.
- Leaving a shift after you promote five players will lead to consequences. You may only leave a shift after it officially concludes.
- If you lose connection or disconnect, the shift will be announced as concluded within #session-notice. However, the shift can continue once you rejoin.
- **Do not reclaim the shift if you disconnect.** Reclaiming will send another announcement and restart the shift timer.
- If you reclaim a shift, there may be consequences for the disruption it can cause.
